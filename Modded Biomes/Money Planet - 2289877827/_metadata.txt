You can get so much money here it's actually BROKEN! RICH FOREVER!!!\n\n[b][i]If an update is done, you'll want to travel to a new planet that is quite a distance from your current location in the universe. Then, the updated planets will show up! Staying on old planets won't corrupt your game, they just won't have any of the new content.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1][b][u][i]UNINSTALLING A PLANET MOD CAN CORRUPT THE UNIVERSE FILE. Be careful when installing this mod! Get it only if you really think you'll like it![/i][/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Here's how it works:[/h1]\n[b]If you installed the mod, explored around to new systems and found Money planets, you shouldn't uninstall the mod unless you want your universe to be corrupted. That is because if you remove it, the game will still look for the assets used to create that planet, since it essentially still exists within the universe. It will crash because all the files are missing. There is no way around this except to delete your universe file. You will get to keep your characters, but any builds on planets / explored planets will be gone. The regular vanilla planets will begin to generate again once the file is deleted.[/b]\n\n--------------[b]Extras[/b]--------------\nThere IS a Terraformer for the Money biome!\n[i]om_moneyplanet_terraformer[/i]\n\nTrueSpace Compatible\n\n[h1][b]Hey, psst!
