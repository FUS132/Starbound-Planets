  "description" : "NOTE: This version of the mod was developed like a year ago or more, and I only recently uploaded it on request in a WIP state. As of right now it has 2 bugs and personally I am still not fully satisfied with the biome parallaxes of some of the new biomes. Critique welcome but take into account that I might not update this mod further. ALSO this mod is not compatible with V1 as it overhauls A LOT of internal stuff.\nThe bugs are:\n- For some reason the endless poison lakes in the poison lake biome crash the game in a spectacular way, so I had to temporarily disable them :(.\n- For some strange reason radioactive gas giants don't have atmospheres. From my tests it only happens in radioactive ones despite all surface biomes in them having atmosphere colors.\nFor Starters:\n-YES, it is compatible with FU, TrueSpace and Allow Parallax Transition. Fixed FU gas giant core incompatiblity issues.\n\n-THIS MOD ONLY WORKS ON NEWLY GENERATED SYSTEMS, that is, systems that you have not loaded from the cockpit's hud (outide of the area that you can see).\n\nLORE: A few sciencists were researching alien gas giants and found ancient structures in their low atmospheres that allowed for small pockets of stable updrafts in them, allowing \"skylands\" with life to develop on the updrafts. You are lucky, because your ship so happens to have a prototype teleporter that is able to teleport you to these stable areas.\n\nA mod that replaces the current unlandable gas giants with many types of gas giants. These gas giant (except the unterraformed variant) posses 1 layer of vanilla-like biomes depending on the gas giant type (forest/desert/snow/radioactive) with larger \" sky continents\", smaller islands and empty voids, the bottom of the top 2 layers and the lower layers are filled with a \"updraft\" that allows you to swim and can be destroyed if the background is blocked and the updraft mined witht he matter manipulator, allowing you to not fall straight to the core by mistake. That said, you still need to be careful of the ridiculously strong ancient drones in the lower layers of the gas giants as they are extremely fast and hurt a ton. That said, the lower areas of gas giants are filled to the brim with all kinds of ores and there is multiple surprises in the bottom if you manage to reach it. A high tier mech with the ability to fly is recommended.\n\nGas Giants from this mod have the same ores as asteroid fields, so I recommend installing a mod like asteroids oresteroids for extra grofit: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=793531552\nPairs well with \"dangerous asteroid fields\" by yours trully which adds mech enemies to asteroid fields, making them endless mech part farms and a way to recharge the mech for mining expeditions.",
