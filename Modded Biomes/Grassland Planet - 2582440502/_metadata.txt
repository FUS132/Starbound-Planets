[i]Thank you for your patience.[/i]\n[hr][/hr]\n[hr][/hr]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[img]https://imgur.com/Rp7RNLp.png[/img]\n[h1]Want a calm, friendly, \"Earth-like\" planet? [i](But also not an exact copy?)[/i] Here's one![/h1]\nWelcome to [b]Grassland Planet[/b], a mod that adds a brand NEW planet type to your universe!\n\n[b]Grassland planets are hilly, vibrant planets with rich soil and colourful flora.[/b] Their rich soil makes them the best planets for farming, so a lot of farmers are drawn here! You'll find wild animals, plenty of crops, and more!\n[i]But keep an eye out for tornadoes, the planets' deadliest, unique weather type![/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[img]https://imgur.com/yVEY16V.png[/img]\n[h1][u][b]Grassland Planet (Version 1.2)[/b][/u] [b][FINAL VERSION][/b][/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tier 1/2\n    [*]Gentle & Temperate Stars\n    [*]Custom Weather(s)\n    [*]Custom Parallaxes\n    [*]Unique Terrain Generation\n    [*]Custom Biome Encounters + Vanilla\n    [*]Custom Dungeons (Large Encounters) + Vanilla Encounters\n    [*]Custom NPCs\n    [*]Custom Terraformer\n    [*]Appears on Vanilla Planets\n    [*]\"Wild Grassland\" Sub-Biome (No Encounters with Civilization)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Note:[/b] There is not only EF5 Tornadoes. There is also the EF1 and EF3 types. [i]And, if you want to, you can avoid Tornadoes altogether, since Grassland planets have varied weather combinations![/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[img]https://imgur.com/Q76hvfD.png[/img]\nDoesn't exist, yet!\n[b]However, the mod is still FU compatible! [i](It just doesn't have any special FU-biome debuffs, ores, encounters, or etc.)[/i][/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b][i]If an update is done, you'll want to travel to a new planet that is quite a distance from your current location in the universe. Then, the updated planets will show up! Staying on old planets won't corrupt your game, they just won't have any of the new content.[/i][/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[img]https://imgur.com/GUkPFm8.png[/img]\n[h1][b][u][i]UNINSTALLING A PLANET MOD CAN CORRUPT THE UNIVERSE FILE. Be careful when installing this mod! Get it only if you really think you'll like it![/i][/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Here's how it works:[/h1]\n[b]If you installed the mod, explored around to new systems and found Grassland planets, you shouldn't uninstall the mod unless you want your universe to be corrupted. That is because if you remove it, the game will still look for the assets used to create that planet, since it essentially still exists within the universe. It will crash because all the files are missing. There is no way around this except to delete your universe file. You will get to keep your characters, but any builds on planets / explored planets will be gone. The regular vanilla planets will begin to generate again once the file is deleted.[/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[img]https://imgur.com/UFTJVPg.png[/img]\n[h1][b]This Mod is Feature-Complete:[/b][/h1]\nI consider this mod to be feature-complete. The mod isn't too complex or crazy, but that's just the way I want it. A simple but peaceful planet mod that uses mostly vanilla assets - but can be experienced in a whole new way. Thank you for being interested in this mod!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[img]https://imgur.com/L2ysg8J.png[/img]\nPlease refer to one of the forums at the bottom of this page.\nIf you encounter a fatal error (or regular error), please go to: [b]Starbound folder > Storage > starbound.log[/b]\nPlease open the first and unnumbered starbound.log and paste the contents to [b]pastebin[/b]!
