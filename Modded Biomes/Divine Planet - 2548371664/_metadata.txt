I got the perfect solution for you![/h1]\nWelcome to [b]Divine Planet[/b], a mod that adds a brand NEW planet type to your universe!\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/GlEt8g2.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1]--------------[u][b]Divine Planet (Version 1.0)[/b][/u]--------------[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tier 8\n    [*]Temperate Star\n    [*]No Oxygen\n    [*]Custom Blocks (Planet + Building Blocks)\n    [*]Custom Weathers\n    [*]Custom Parallaxes\n    [*]Custom Underground Biomes AND Core\n    [*]Custom Encounters/Custom Terrain\n    [*]Custom Divine Furniture\n    [*]Custom Encounter Dungeons/Maps\n    [*]Custom Ore\n    [*][b]MUCH MORE PLANNED!![/b]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Planned[/u]--------------[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]More Sky Colours\n    [*]More Custom Objects/Furniture/Deco\n    [*]More Custom Dungeons (Encounters)\n    [*]More Custom Dungeons (Planet Dungeons)\n    [*]Custom Weapons + Armours\n    [*]Custom NPCs/Crewmember/Tenant\n    [*]Custom Monsters (Angels)\n    [*]More Betabound Support\n[/list]\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/QbnjWnv.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1]Material IDs, Liquid ID, and Mod Conflicts[/h1]\n[b][i][u]Material IDs Used by This Mod:[/u][/i][/b] 9300-9308\n[b][i][u]CONFLICTS:[/u][/i][/b] None yet!\n\n[h1][b]Frackin Universe Support[/b][/h1]\nDoesn't exist, yet!\n[b]However, the mod is still FU compatible! [i](It just doesn't have any special FU-biome debuffs, ores, encounters, or etc.)[/i][/b]\n\n[b][i]If an update is done, you'll want to travel to a new planet that is quite a distance from your current location in the universe. Then, the updated planets will show up! Staying on old planets won't corrupt your game, they just won't have any of the new content.[/i][/b]\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/jI1qjnr.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1][b][u][i]UNINSTALLING A PLANET MOD CAN CORRUPT THE UNIVERSE FILE. Be careful when installing this mod! Get it only if you really think you'll like it![/i][/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Here's how it works:[/h1]\n[b]If you installed the mod, explored around to new systems and found Divine planets, you shouldn't uninstall the mod unless you want your universe to be corrupted. That is because if you remove it, the game will still look for the assets used to create that planet, since it essentially still exists within the universe. It will crash because all the files are missing. There is no way around this except to delete your universe file. You will get to keep your characters, but any builds on planets / explored planets will be gone. The regular vanilla planets will begin to generate again once the file is deleted.[/b]\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/9U2J8x3.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1]Have a problem?[/h1]\nPlease refer to one of the forums at the bottom of this page.\nIf you encounter a fatal error (or regular error), please go to: [b]Starbound folder > Storage > starbound.log[/b]\nPlease open the first and unnumbered starbound.log and paste the contents to [b]pastebin[/b]!
