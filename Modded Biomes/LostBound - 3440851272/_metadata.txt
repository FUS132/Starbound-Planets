Explore ruined skyscrapers, enigmatic bunkers, abandoned highways, and once-vibrant shops, now marked by time and forgotten secrets.\n\n[h2]Immersive and Atmospheric Environment[/h2]\nEvery corner of the city tells a story. Deserted streets, eroded facades, and scattered urban details create a unique atmosphere of mystery and decay, inviting adventurers to unravel enigmas and uncover relics of the past.\n\n\n[h2]Integration with Other Mods[/h2]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3440385324]Overgrown Planets[/url] – Adds seamless compatibility with planets where vegetation has reclaimed the environment.\n\nScorched Planets (Already included) – Expands arid and hostile landscapes with a ruined, post-apocalyptic atmosphere.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3440345640]More Planet Info Patch[/url] – Enhances exploration with additional planetary details.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2329389933]Hypothermic Planets[/url] – Perfect for those who enjoy frozen wastelands.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3449986988]Radioactive Planets[/url] – Find relics from a world ravaged by disaster.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3450054773]Truespace Patch[/url] – For those who crave a truly immersive deep-space experience.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3455385368]FU Wasteland Planets Patch:[/url] for Frackin enjoyers\n\n\n[h1]Uninstalling:[/h1]\nThis mod introduces new planets and biomes, making uninstallation potentially unsafe.
