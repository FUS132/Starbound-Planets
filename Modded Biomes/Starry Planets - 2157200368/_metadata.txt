  "description" : "[h1]Ever wanted to go to planets that are dreamy and wondrous? Now you can![/h1]\nWelcome to [b]Starry Planets[/b], a mod that adds [b]TWO brand NEW planet types[/b] to your universe!\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/PT2Y0o7.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Starry Planet Mod[b](Final Version)[/b][/u]--------------[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tier 4 Planets (Starry Planet & Starry Ocean)\n    [*]Radioactive Stars\n    [*]Radiation Planets\n    [*]Custom Blocks (Planet + Building Blocks)\n    [*]Custom Weathers\n    [*]Custom Parallaxes\n    [*]Custom Trees/Plants\n    [*]Custom Sub-Biomes\n    [*]Custom Underground Biomes AND Sub-Biomes\n    [*]Custom Farmable Plant\n    [*]Custom Liquid\n    [*]Custom Foods\n    [*]Custom Critters\n    [*]Custom Monsters\n    [*]Custom Encounters/Custom Terrain\n    [*]Custom Starry Furniture\n    [*]Starry Cultist NPC, Tentant, Guards and More!\n    [*]Starry Cultist Palace, Apex Starry Liquid Facility & Other Dungeons!\n    [*]Custom Ore\n    [*]T4 Weapons, Armour, a Cosmetic Set, and Accessories!\n    [*]Custom Lore\n    [*]Custom Fish (Go Fishing at Starry Oceans)\n    [*]Custom Instance World: Unustrello's Starry Caf√©!\n[/list]\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/MzZl1dD.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1]Material IDs, Liquid ID, and Mod Conflicts[/h1]\n[b][i][u]Material IDs Used by This Mod:[/u][/i][/b] 53350-53364\n[b][i][u]Liquid ID Used by This Mod:[/u][/i][/b] 34\n[b][i][u]CONFLICTS:[/u][/i][/b] Liquid ID 34 - Extended Story mod\nThe \"Super Heated Lava\" from Extended Story has the same ID as Starry Liquid, causing a conflict. The Starry Liquid gets replaced by the Lava, cause the planet's sprite to mess up/appear massive and for the Starry Liquid to entirely disappear. [b]IT IS NOT POSSIBLE for me to change the ID or else SB loads infinitely.[/b] The liquid ID can only be changed completely if a universe reset is done (player-side), but I wouldn't want current subscribers to do that to their worlds. My apologies. At least it does not cause a crash from the reports I've gotten..\n\n[i]A Workaround[/i]: The latest GitHub version of Extended Story has the Super Heated Lava liquid with a different ID. If you currently have ES, you may want to reset the universe, since switching to a new liquid ID can mess up any old worlds. Or if you plan on getting ES, I recommend getting the GitHub version if you want these mods to work together.\n\n[h1][b]Frackin Universe Support[/b][/h1]\n[u]Please get this FU Support Patch[/u]: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2287046122] FU + Starry Planets Support Patch [/url]\n\n[b][i]If an update is done, you'll want to travel to a new planet that is quite a distance from your current location in the universe. Then, the updated planets will show up! Staying on old planets won't corrupt your game, they just won't have any of the new content.[/i][/b]\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/Ln5NAXh.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1][b][u][i]UNINSTALLING A PLANET MOD CAN CORRUPT THE UNIVERSE FILE. Be careful when installing this mod! Get it only if you really think you'll like it![/i][/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Here's how it works:[/h1]\n[b]If you installed the mod, explored around to new systems and found Starry planets, you shouldn't uninstall the mod unless you want your universe to be corrupted. That is because if you remove it, the game will still look for the assets used to create that planet, since it essentially still exists within the universe. It will crash because all the files are missing. There is no way around this except to delete your universe file. You will get to keep your characters, but any builds on planets / explored planets will be gone. The regular vanilla planets will begin to generate again once the file is deleted.[/b]\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/1JrXKAM.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1][b]Extras[/b][/h1]\n[b]There IS a Terraformer for the Starry biome![/b]\n[i]om_starryplanet_terraformer[/i]\n\n[h1]Added support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2422986190]Futara's Dragon Pixel Full Bright Shader[/url]![/h1]\n\nBuilt-In TrueSpace Support\n\nBuilt-In MorePlanetInfo Support\n\nBuilt-In RPG Growth Support\n\n[IMG]https://imgur.com/yYcDfpw.png[/IMG]\n\n[h1][b]Hey, psst!
