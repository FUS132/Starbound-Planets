  "description" : "[h1]So you're tired of safe, habitable planets.. What about a planet that is literally HELL?[/h1]\nWelcome to [b]Hellish Planet[/b], a mod that adds a brand NEW planet type to your universe!\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Hellish Planet[/u]--------------[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tier 6/7\n    [*]Hot / Hell Planet\n    [*]Custom EPP\n    [*]Custom Blocks & Weather\n    [*]Custom Unique Enemies (More will be added)\n    [*]Custom Terrain / Parallaxes\n    [*]Custom Encounters/Dungeons\n    [*]Custom Ore & Bar\n    [*]Hellish Weapons\n    [*]NEW!! Hellish Armor\n    [*]Custom Soundtracks (3)\n[/list]\n\n--------------[b]To Do[/b]--------------\n[list]\n    [*]More Custom Mobs\n    [*]More Encounters/Dungeons\n    [*]Mini-Boss / Boss Monster(?)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Hiatus[/u]--------------[/h1]\nJust want you to know, this mod is currently under a hiatus until further notice. [i]I really want to feature a custom boss fight featuring the talking Demon Guy, but that means learning how to make a boss with custom moves[/i]. I want to learn how to do that with another mod first. [i]Then, I'll come back here![/i]\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Exploration[/u]--------------[/h1]\nThis planet is going to have heavy themes of exploration! I want to have small dungeons, but also large ones that can be conquered and possibly used as bases! Not only that, but so many new foes will be added that I'll remove randomly generating enemies from the biome entirely (when the time is right). That's why as I update this mod more and more, brand new enemies, dungeons, and challenges will await you(--with proper rewards of course.)\nSome planet will generate with more build-friendly weather, and some will generate with meteors that can rain from the sky and destroy blocks.\n\n[h1]Material IDs and Mod Conflicts[/h1]\n[b][i][u]Material IDs Used by This Mod:[/u][/i][/b] 54200-54206\n\n[b][i]If an update is done, you'll want to travel to a new planet that is quite a distance from your current location in the universe. Then, the updated planets will show up! Staying on old planets won't corrupt your game, they just won't have any of the new content.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1][b][u][i]UNINSTALLING A PLANET MOD CAN CORRUPT THE UNIVERSE FILE. Be careful when installing this mod! Get it only if you really think you'll like it![/i][/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Here's how it works:[/h1]\n[b]If you installed the mod, explored around to new systems and found Hellish planets, you shouldn't uninstall the mod unless you want your universe to be corrupted. That is because if you remove it, the game will still look for the assets used to create that planet, since it essentially still exists within the universe. It will crash because all the files are missing. There is no way around this except to delete your universe file. You will get to keep your characters, but any builds on planets / explored planets will be gone. The regular vanilla planets will begin to generate again once the file is deleted.[/b]\n\n--------------[b]Extras[/b]--------------\nThere IS a Terraformer for the Hellish biome!\n[i]hellishplanet_terraformer[/i]\n\nTrueSpace Compatible\n\nMPI Compatible\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2251067429] Vanilla Hazard Protection When Playing FU [/url]\n[i](This allows FU users to get an EPP that is compatible with modded planets that have vanilla planet biome debuffs.)[/i]\n\n[h1][b]Hey, psst!
