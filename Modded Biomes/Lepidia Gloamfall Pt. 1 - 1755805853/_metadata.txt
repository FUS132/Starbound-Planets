  "description" : "[h1][u]Gloamfall Update Pt.1 (Ship Update Patch)[/u][/h1]\n[b]Requires a Race Slot Extender mod of some kind![/b]\n\nThis update adds new content to the original Lepidoptians race mod, including a new planet type, materials, new customization options, farmables, reskinned ship, and food recipes.\n\n[b]Please see change notes for the specific details of this update![/b]\n\n[b][u]Old Characters:[/u][/b]\nCharacters from before the update work just fine! To access the new Gloamfall planets, load new stars in your navigation screen.\n\nExisting characters SHOULD work with the ship reskin just fine. The ship is a reskinned human ship with the same inner structure to avoid causing errors. If an error does occur, or your game crashes loading a character, try these:\n[list]\n[*]Try starting the game up and loading that same character again. Sometimes they will work the second time you load!\n[*]Ship world reset, which is the most extreme option. Guides for this procedure exist, but please [b][u]remember to back up your data[/u][/b] before attempting anything from any guide. i am not responsible for any data loss that may occur from doing this improperly\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Base Content[/h3]\n-Lepidia Playable Race\nOriginal mod included unique customizations, racial flag, unique voice, unique clothes and dyable wings, racial crafter for furniture, and tenants.\n\n[h3]New Content[/h3]\n-Autumn-themed Gloamfall Planets with farmables (Pumpkin, Squash, Gourd) and unique weather conditions (thus far)\n-Terraformer for the new planet type\n-7 Food Items/recipes\n-Over 200 body colours, over 80 antennae/fluff combinations and 40 colours, and over 20 eye colours\n-56 wings, originals re-sprited and many more added\n-Re-sprited clothing items\n-A reskinned human ship and a custom ship pet with variants (pets are also purchasable for all races)\n-Unique monster recolours and item drops\n-11 New block materials\n\nMost items in this mod (including blocks) can be crafted at the \"Lepidia Fabricator\", which can be found at the Inventor's Table! It's a pink moth that hangs on the wall. Lepidia colony deeds can be found at Frogg Furnishing. Purchasable Petalbug pets and crop seeds are available at Terramart.\n\nFood items from this mod can be made at the cooking table!\n\n[h3]Part 2[/h3]\nThe goal of Gloamfall Pt. 2 will be to add unique dungeons to Gloamfall planets and Lepidia villages, as well as expanded lore, tiered armour sets, and another playable race.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[u]Meta Stuff:[/u]\nTo explain why the wings are back items: Lepidia aren't meant to be a wingless species canonically. The wings are back items to allow for customization versatility, as many more unique looks can be achieved with custom dyes rather than individual customization options in CC. Lepidian lore also involves them having a shape shifting-like ability to change the appearance of their wings! Having the ability to change the designs and colours around on a single character is meant to match that. For those who choose not to wear wings all the time, we'll explain their absence with being \"hidden\", lmao.\n\n[h3]Compatibility + Recommended[/h3]\nThis mod should be compatible with most other mods! I personally play with 400+ mods active at once, and made sure there were no conflicts with anything I personally use.\n\n[b]Green's Dye Suite[/b] - Recommended for wing dyes (thumbnail features wings dyed with this mod!)\n[b]Race Traits[/b] - By Oмεяυıп; now includes Lepidia trait support!\n[b]Arcana[/b] - Gloamfall planets can spawn around Arcana stars\n[b]Maple32[/b] - Gloamfall planets can spawn alongside Maple32 planets\n[b]Other Planet Mods[/b] - I personally use many planet/biome mods; Gloamfall causes no conflict with any of them that I am aware of\n\nLepidia: Gloamfall uses the following material and mod (for ores) IDs:\n15555-15566 (blocks)\n15567, 15568 (ores)\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[u]Credits:[/u]\nCyan Sky Knight for inspiration\nDrPvtSkittles for Race and Custom Crafter Templates\n[url=https://www.deviantart.com/maxyvert]Maxyvert[/url] on DA for the texture used in the fabricator skin\n\n[h2] Disclaimer:[/h2] \nDue to someone in the past misunderstanding what plagiarism is:\nI credit Cyan Sky Knight for \"inspiration\" because I wanted to make a race mod before I knew the Saturnians existed. I found them and loved them, and it made me feel more motivated to make my own race, which I wanted to also be moth-based. :3\nMoths just happen to be one of my special interests, so I wanted to put my own spin on it!\n\nFor future reference, Cyan Sky Knight has also commented here to clear up that Saturnian assets are free to use anyway. We're just 2 people that made anthros of the same animal. :)\n\nEdit: There's 0 reason to be so offended that 2 moth races exist. :|\n\n[u]Permissions:[/u]\nI've developed Lepidia and Fayents for use as a Starbound mod, but I want to maintain their concepts as my own, since I'd like to use these races again in different projects. However, I don't discourage other modders from making more material for or based on this mod! :) \n\nI only ask that my original assets not be claimed by another author.\n\n---\nThanks for viewing my mod! I hope you like them!\n[b]If you encounter any problems, please [u]post in the bug report discussion thread[/u], and provide the section of your Starbound log file that indicates the error from this mod.[/b]",
