The entire surface of the planet is depressing and void of color except some random structures built by travellers who wanted to spruce the place up.\n\nBeing on the planet will give you depression, which can only be cured by leaving the planet far far behind.\n\nThere is no special loot to find here, there is no benefit to coming. This is a place for those of us who failed as a Protectorate to spend our last remaining days in isolation and depression. \n\n\n8-26  - added terraformer and new Crewtype Best Friend.
