Patches and Addons are at the bottom.[/h1]\n\n[img]https://imgur.com/8GKovMj.png[/img]\nProject Ancient Cosmos is a large mod Endgame expansion, dealing with many ideas I've had for over a year and bringing experiences I've given to Frackin' Universe to those who don't necessarily like it. Centering around the new Tier 7 startype, the Black Hole, this mod adds in many new things to the base game without changing the mechanics much if at all. \n\n[h1]How to Start[/h1]\nTo start, you must have destroyed the Ruin. It is also recommended that you are familiar with the final mission in the Peacekeeper storyline. Speak to Esther again and she will task you with gathering Ancient Essence. Once you do that, follow her instructions and you'll be prepared for the journey ahead.\n\n[img]https://imgur.com/N7dekFO.png[/img]\nThere are many additions to this mod, many of which centering around a specific planet type as a whole.\n\n[h1]New Biomes[/h1]\nThere are many new biomes with the new Cosmic planet type, each with their own structures and lore. Each can only be found on certain planets, so look around for all of them.\n[list]\n    [*]4 Planet Types\n    [*]10 Surface Biomes\n    [*]15 Underground Biomes\n    [*]Over 100 Structures\n    [*]3 New Music Tracks\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Ancient Mysteries[/h1]\nScattered around the many worlds are encrypted codices that you cannot read on your own. So you must translate them yourself with the new Translation Table. These codices will give you new insights into the elusive Ancients, and certain items can be translated to give you more things to craft.\n\nYou may also come across many other codices written by those who sought these planets, though it is telling how fate dealt with them. Tread carefully.\n[list]\n    [*]26 Encrypted Codices\n    [*]17 Normal Codices\n[/list]\n\n[h1]New Equipment[/h1]\nWith the creation of a new tier and star type, that means new equipment. This mod contains many new pieces of equipment based around new materials known as Celesteel and Fluxonite. These will make the planet exploration much easier and help get you to that next step in progression, as per the system.\n\nHowever, there are technically 2 tiers of equipment in this one tier, the starter equipment, and the ones you have to work for. The second tier allows you to craft things like upgraded Unique Weapons, as long as you have the right items to craft them.\n\nTo figure out the recipe for these new pieces of equipment, you must scour the planets for unique items that are found in the many biomes. You must also have unlocked the Ancient Workbench, which can be unlocked after collecting an entire set of Ancient Codices and have found the Workbench Blueprint.\n[list]\n    [*]4 New Armor Sets\n    [*]27 New Weapons\n    [*]17 Unique Weapon Upgrades\n    [*]4 EPPs\n    [*]2 Decorative Armor Sets\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Cosmic Construction[/h1]\nThis mod includes many new blocks and objects to make builds with, based around 3 new crafting materials: Galactree Wood, Enchanium, and Fluxonite.

These give you plenty of options to base new builds around.\n[list]\n    [*]22 New Craftable Tiles\n    [*]37 New Craftable Objects\n[/list]\n\n[h1]...and many more.[/h1]\n\n[img]https://imgur.com/e0EZULa.png[/img]\nQ: Will this mod ever be compatible with FU?\nA: No, however an FU compatible version has been thought of, and may be made.
