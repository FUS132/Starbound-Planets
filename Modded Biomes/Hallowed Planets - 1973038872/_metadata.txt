  "description" : "[h1]Wanna add more variety to your universe? How about AESTHETIC planets? Yes? Then check out the [b]Hallowed Planets[/b]![/h1]\nWelcome to [b]Hallowed Planets[/b], a mod that adds TWO new planet types to your universe.\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Hallowed Ocean[/u]--------------[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tier 3\n    [*]Oceanic Planet\n    [*]Custom Blocks & Weather\n    [*]Custom Farmable Plant\n    [*]Custom Unique Enemies (Terraria References + Clouds)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]--------------[u]Hallowed Planet[/u]--------------[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tier 5\n    [*]Cold/Forest Planet\n    [*]Custom Tree\n    [*]Custom Blocks & Weather\n    [*]Custom Deco Plants\n    [*]Custom Floating Islands\n    [*]Custom Farmable Plant\n    [*]Custom Unique Enemies (Terraria References + Clouds)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Material IDs and Mod Conflicts[/h1]\n[b][i][u]Material IDs Used by This Mod:[/u][/i][/b] 301-310, 3066 \n\n[b][i][u]Conflicts:[/u][/i][/b]\n[list]\nâ€¢Hopefully none!\n[/list]\n\n[b][i]If an update is done, you'll want to travel to a new planet that is quite a distance from your current location in the universe. Then, the updated planets will show up! Staying on old planets won't corrupt your game, they'll just look REALLY WEIRD and unfinished.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1][b][u][i]UNINSTALLING A PLANET MOD CAN CORRUPT THE UNIVERSE FILE. Be careful when installing this mod! Get it only if you really think you'll like it![/i][/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Here's how it works:[/h1]\n[b]If you installed the mod, explored around to new systems and found Hallowed planets, you shouldn't uninstall the mod unless you want your universe to be corrupted. That is because if you remove it, the game will still look for the assets used to create that planet, since it essentially still exists within the universe. It will crash because all the files are missing. There is no way around this except to delete your universe file. You will get to keep your characters, but any builds on planets / explored planets will be gone. The regular vanilla planets will begin to generate again once the file is deleted.[/b]\n\n[h1]I consider this mod to be feature-complete.[/h1]\nHowever, if there are any bugs--I will, of course, fix them. As for updating the mod further, nothing will really change unless I have an idea/get a good recommendation I want to add to the mod.\n\n--------------[b]Extras[/b]--------------\n[i]There IS a Terraformer for the Hallowed Planet biome![/i]\n\n[h1][b]Hey, psst! I made a Discord Server for anyone who's interested![/b]\nYou can join if you wanna talk, look at WIP updates, discuss modding, etc![/h1]\n                                                                 [b] https://discord.gg/MnEQNbE [/b]\n                                                          [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/6DwoYtS.png[/IMG]\n\n--------------[b]Credits[/b]--------------\nChuckle Fish - Vanilla Assets\nRe-Logic - Original Hallow Biome Monster Designs\n[b]bk3000 - Coding for TrueSpace Compatibility[/b] (built into mod)",
