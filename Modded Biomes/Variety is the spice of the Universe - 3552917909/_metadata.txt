  "description" : "[h1] About this mod[/h1]\n\nVariety is the spice of the Universe is a mod which is designed to add well, variety to your universe. It adds new weather types, new biomes, more biome music, all that fun stuff.\n\nIn vanilla, certain biomes are restricted to later sectors for no apparent reason.\nInstead, restrictions in this mod are based upon how exotic a biome is.\n\nYou can now find volcanic biomes in the Alpha sector, for example.\nBut you won't see some of my mods more exotic biomes, like the Living biome, in the Alpha sector.\n\nAlso in vanilla, the distance between a planet and it's star doesn't matter. You can find snow biomes next to a star.\nThis mod also changes that, too.\n\nSick of hearing happy music in a lava filled world? No longer!\nThe unused exploration songs have been made used, and songs which don't fit in a biome have been removed.\nBiomes with more songs: Desert, Snow, Tundra, Arctic, Snow Forest, Ocean\nBiomes with specific songs: Magma, Volcanic, Frostfire, Tarball, Tentacles, Living, Deep Ocean\n\nYou can find over ten new weather types with this mod in the current version.\n    Sandstorms and strong sandstorms\n    Blizzards\n    Diamond dust\n    Crystal dust\n    Ash\n    Volcanic eruption\n    Tar rain, drizzle and storms\n    Tentacle juice rain, drizzle and storms\n    Acid drizzle and storms\n    Sulfuric eruption\n    Ash/Snow mix\n    Eruption/Ice cube storm mix\n\n    The Frostfire\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    Cold but hot, icy yet covered with lava. Mining here is high risk, high reward as crystals grow in the caverns below. Even with lava can get cold on the surface, it will even snow instead of rain.\n    \n    Swamplands\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet without Dungeons/Villages\n    A murky, wet biome. Exactly how you'd expect a swamp to look like.\n    \n    Living Planet\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    Just as the name says, it's a living planet. Only found at Sector X.(Will be at more sectors when Chucklefish creates them!)\n    \n    Wasteland\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A boring, desolate biome. Not much more to it.\n    \n    Tarball\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A giant planet of tar, slime, sewage and bones. Mostly tar, though. Only found past the Delta sector.\n    \n    Mountainous\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A biome where mountains peak high into the sky. Trees are rare and the biome is very rocky.\n    \n    Crystal Forest\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A forest of crystals, loosely based upon some Starbound concept art. Only found past the Beta sector. =Outdated Image=\n    \n    The Umbra\n    Type: Lightless Planet\n    There is no natural light in this biome. And the blocks are made of darkness.\n    Good luck.\n    \n    Charred Forest\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A very, very hot biome. Poor forest.\n    \n    Boreal Forest\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    Don't touch the needles!\n    \n    The Twilight\n    Type: Twilight Terrestrial Planet\n    Twilight in the day, pitch black at night.\n\n    Spooky Forest\n    Type: Permanight Terrestrial Planet\n    Eternal night, no music and overall typical horror forest stuff awaits you here.\n    \n    The Heck\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    No, I didn't name it! Chucklefish did. Blame them! I just made it a planetary biome and not just an underground biome.\n    \n    Metallic Moon\n    Type: Permanight Moon\n    Eternal night... Cold... No atmosphere... Lava... Yeah. It's dangerous. Only found at Sector X.\n    \n    Crystal Moon\n    Type: Moon\n    Covered in crystals, this moon biome is great incase you want them. Only found past the Delta sector. You cannot breathe on this planet.\n    \n    Rainbow Woods\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    Oooh, pretty!\n    \n    Mushroom Forest\n    Type: Permanight Terrestrial Planet\n    It's always night in this biome for an unknown reason, but it's littered in glowing mushrooms.\n    \n    Cove\n    Type: Dungeonless Terrestrial Planet\n    Inspired by Dire Dire Docks & Jolly Roger Bay from Super Mario 64, this biome shares a similar atmosphere.\n    \n    Snowy Icelands\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    The perfect place to get ice crystals. Ice spikes are everywhere, making it slightly hard to traverse.    \n\n    Flower Field\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A planet covered in flowers, both giant, small and modestly sized.\n    \n    Volcanic Forest\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A uncommon forest biome variation.\n    \n    Volcanic - Sulphuric\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A different look to the typical volcanic biomes you see everywhere.\n    \n    Snow Forest\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    It's like a snow biome, but with the amount of flora a forest would have. More dirty then the snow biome.\n    \n    Mountainous - Snowy\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet\n    A snowy variant of the mountainous biome.\n\n    Ocean\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet without Dungeons/Villages\n    Wide open waters and islands. It's also very deep. Waters are infinite here.\n\n    This biome is slightly buggy, which is probably one of the primary reasons it was disabled by Chucklefish. That doesn't stop it from being a great biome to build on, though!\n    Issues from vanilla:\n    Broken underground parallax | Status: Unpatchable with current parallax system\n    Lack of Hylotl settlements | Status: Not implemented into vanilla files, generation broken\n    \n    Arctic\n    Type: Normal Terrestrial Planet without Dungeons/Villages\n    A cold, frozen ocean. The water is freezing cold... don't stay in it for long at all.\n    Issues from vanilla:\n    Broken underground parallax | Status: Unpatchable with current parallax system    \n\t\t\n[h1] ====================================================[/h1]\nThe Variety is the spice of the Universe Reborn is a functional version of a very old mod (11 years) without updates. Since it's a working version and not open-source, the goal is solely to create a playable version, respecting the author's rights. To be clear: [h1]NOTHING WILL BE ADDED TO THE MOD.[/h1]\n\nThe mod adds 83 new planets containing 83 new biomes. 23 subbiomes are found attached to only a few different planets. All files for each biome have been repaired, including the parallax, biome, and terrain files, which have all been redone. The only thing I haven't changed because I'm not sure it's valid is the cockpit icons for each planet. They now all have the same cockpit identification icon, making it easier to locate VITSOU planets. It's also worth noting that all planets end with \"VITSOU\" at the end of their descriptions. I also added the use of the BETABOUND mod, as it features elements from the Starbound beta, such as monsters and liquids. All item and metal recipes have been removed. I decided to release the mod now, with limited testing, as I'm very busy with work this month. Testing each planet, and the many biomes and subbiomes, can take a long time to hunt down bugs. By releasing it now, I hope that bugs will be more easily found with mod subscribers. And I'll highlight this here:\n\n[h1]CREATE A NEW SAVE TO USE THE MOD, AS IT MAY CORRUPT YOUR WORLD! AND I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, OK? AND IF YOU FIND ANY BUG, PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN FIX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!![/h1]\n\nI hope you enjoy this reborn version, it took me a long time to recreate it and all because of a damn SPACE, but okay I guess it wasn't the time back then. kkk\n\nNote: Incompatible for Frackin Universe, as it is already added!!\n\nMod Original: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/variety-is-the-spice-of-the-universe.199/ (the nexus version was removed for some reason..)\nAutor original: Dracyoshi",
