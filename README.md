# Starbound-Planets
All mod files related to patching every planet in Starbound, modded or not. Contributors always welcome.

There are 3 versions of terrestrial_worlds.config.patch:
1. For land planets;
2. For oceanic planets, because adding dungeons to them tends to cause game crashes;
3. For moons just to keep them separate.

All .biome files are sorted by their mod folders, with preserved directory structure inside.
